# Intermediate-Axis-Theorem
Python code used to make the simulation in [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/68aFSgn3LAY).

# Dependencies
- Python 2.7 (NOT python 3)  
- VPython (download for [windows](https://vpython.org/contents/download_windows.html), [mac](https://vpython.org/contents/download_mac.html), [linux](https://vpython.org/contents/download_linux.html))  
**NOTE**: My video was made using VPython 3.6. The library is all the way up to release 6.0. I have *no idea* if this works with VPython 6.0. If you try it with VPython 6.0, please let me know whether or not it works.
